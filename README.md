# PINN (PINN is not NOOBS)
#### An enhanced Operating System installer for the Raspberry Pi

PINN is a version of the NOOBS Operating System Installer for the Raspberry Pi. See the change history below for the additional features.

### - [If you have PINN v2.4.3 - v2.4.4b installed, please manually update to v2.4.4c or later](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=142574&start=200#p1239359)

Documentation on how to use PINN can be found in **[README_PINN.md](README_PINN.md)**, which includes all of the original NOOBS documentation.

If you are already familiar with NOOBS' features, you may prefer to read the reduced documenation that just contains **[PINN's new features](changes.md)** alone.

The latest version of **[PINN-lite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pinn/files/pinn-lite.zip)** can be downloaded from [sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pinn).

Source code is available from [github](https://github.com/procount/pinn)

see  [github](https://github.com/procount/pinn) for full information

## Quick Start

#### Format your SD card as FAT32

For **Windows** users, we recommend formatting your SD card using the SD Association's Formatting Tool, which can be downloaded from https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/ .
If you are still using v4 of this tool, you will need to set the "FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT" option to "ON" in the "Options" menu to ensure that the entire SD card volume is formatted - not just a single partition. However, this tool has now been upgraded to v5 where this feature is now the default and is no longer selectable. For more detailed and beginner-friendly formatting instructions, please refer to http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide .

The SD Association's Formatting Tool is also available for <b>Mac</b> users. However, note that the default OSX Disk Utility is also capable of formatting the entire disk (select the SD card volume and choose "Erase" with "MS-DOS" format).

For **Linux** users, we recommend `gparted` (or the command line version `parted`). (Update: Norman Dunbar has written up the following formatting instructions for Linux users: http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/NOOBS-for-raspberry-pi/)

#### Copy the pinn files to your SD card.

- Download **[pinn-lite.zip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pinn/files/pinn-lite.zip)** from [sourceforge](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pinn)
- Extract the files from pinn-lite.zip file onto the SD card. (Windows built-in zip features may have trouble with this file. If so, use another program such as 7zip.)

Please note that in some cases it may extract the files into a folder, if this is the case then please copy across the files from inside the folder rather than the folder itself.

#### Boot pinn on your PI
- Put the PINN SD card into your Pi and boot it.
- On first boot the "RECOVERY" FAT partition will be automatically resized to a minimum, so if you ever put your SD card back into a Windows machine it will look like a very small partition. THIS IS NORMAL.
- PINN does not come supplied with any OSes. You must download them from the internet or provide them on a USB stick. So,....
- Connect your Pi to the internet with an Ethernet cable (easiest)
- Or If you prefer to use Wifi, click on the wifi button and select your SSID and password. If the wifi button is greyed out, choose another type of wifi dongle.
- A list of OSes that are available to install will be displayed.
- Select one or more OSes that you want and click INSTALL.
