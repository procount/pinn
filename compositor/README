A minimal example showing what is required to get a C++ based compositor up
and running. Input events are not delivered to clients, to avoid the logic
for finding the correct window and map the coordinates. This example uses the
IVI-application shell protocol, positioning windows based on the ivi_id.

See the qwindow-compositor example for information on how to implement
support for key and mouse events, and everything else a proper desktop
compositor needs.
