Subject: [PATCH] ARM: stm32f249-disco: don't force init= in /chosen/bootargs

There is no reason to override the kernel's default init= value, as
this breaks userspace that assumes the kernel default of /init is
used. Since stm32 is often used with a minimal bootloader
(afboot-stm32) that doesn't provide any mechanism to override the DTB,
we need to adjust the kernel command line in the Device Tree source.
