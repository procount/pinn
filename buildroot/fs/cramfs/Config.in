	  For ELF files, uncompressed and properly aligned data blocks
	  will be automatically be mapped directly into user space
	  whenever possible providing eXecute-In-Place (XIP) from ROM
	  of read-only segments. Data segments mapped read-write
	  (hence they have to be copied to RAM) may still be
	  compressed in the cramfs image in the same file along with
	  non compressed read-only segments. Both MMU and no-MMU
	  systems are supported. This is particularly handy for tiny
	  embedded systems with very tight memory constraints.

	  The CRAMFS_MTD Kconfig option must also be enabled in a
	  4.15+ kernel.
