	  Integrate the root filesystem generated by Buildroot as an
	  initramfs inside the kernel image. This integration will
	  take place automatically.

	  A rootfs.cpio file will be generated in the images/ directory.
	  This is the archive that will be included in the kernel image.
	  The default rootfs compression set in the kernel configuration
	  is used, regardless of how buildroot's cpio archive is
	  configured.

	  Note that enabling initramfs together with another filesystem
	  formats doesn't make sense: you would end up having two
	  identical root filesystems, one embedded inside the kernel
	  image, and one separately.
