	  The Advanced XIP File System is a Linux kernel filesystem
	  driver that enables files to be executed directly from flash
	  or ROM memory rather than being copied into RAM. It has the
	  ability to store individual *pages* in a file
	  uncompressed/XIP or compressed/Demand Paged.

	  So far, the only supported mode is 'XIP all', so all the
	  files that have the execute attribute set will be XIP'ed.

	  At the moment, the FS is not supported in Linux mainline
	  (v4.3-rc5), so the kernel has to be built with the axfs
	  patches to be able to read it. Patches can be found at:
