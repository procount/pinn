	  Enabling this option will compile and install the uClibc-ng
	  test suite. This is useful if you want to check if the
	  uClibc-ng library is working for your architecture and/or
	  help developing uClibc-ng.

	  The test suite will be installed into
	  /usr/lib/uclibc-ng-test directory. To run the test suite
	  enter the /usr/lib/uclibc-ng-test/test directory and type
	  "sh uclibcng-testrunner.sh".

	  See the /usr/lib/uclibc-ng-test/test/README for additional
	  information.

	  This is not needed at all for normal builds, so you can
	  safely say no if you do not plan to dig into your C library.

	  The tests can also be used for GNU libc or musl.
