	  SMCRoute is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast
	  routes of a UNIX kernel. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6
	  multicast routing. SMCRoute can be used as an alternative to
	  dynamic multicast routers like mrouted or pimd in setups
	  where static multicast routes should be maintained and/or no
	  proper IGMP or MLD signaling exists.
