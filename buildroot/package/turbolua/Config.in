	  Turbo.lua is a framework built for LuaJIT 2 to simplify the
	  task of building fast and scalable network applications. It
	  uses a event-driven, non-blocking, no thread design to deliver
	  excellent performance and minimal footprint to high-load
	  applications while also providing excellent support for
	  embedded uses. The toolkit can be used for HTTP REST API's,
	  traditional dynamic web pages through templating, open
	  connections like WebSockets, or just as high level building
	  blocks for native speed network applications.
