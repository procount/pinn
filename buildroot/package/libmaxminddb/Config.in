	  C library for the MaxMind DB file format

	  The libmaxminddb library provides a C library for reading
	  MaxMind DB files, including the GeoIP2 databases from
	  MaxMind.  This is a custom binary format designed to
	  facilitate fast lookups of IP addresses while allowing for
	  great flexibility in the type of data associated with an
	  address.

	  The MaxMind DB format is an open format. The spec is
