	  OpenTyrian is a port of the DOS shoot-em-up Tyrian. It uses
	  SDL, making it easily cross-platform.
	  It requires the original data files to run.
	  A display with minimum 640x480 resolution and a keyboard are
	  needed to play the game.
	  If you want some sound, activate ALSA with OSS emulation.
