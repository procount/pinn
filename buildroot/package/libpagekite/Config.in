	  PageKite is a protocol for dynamic, tunneled reverse proxying
	  of arbitrary TCP byte streams. It is particularly well suited
	  for making a HTTP server on a device without a public IP
	  address visible to the wider Internet, but can also be used
	  for a variety of other things, including SSH access.

	  libpagekite is a tight, fast implementation of the PageKite
	  protocol in C, suitable for high-performance or embedded
	  applications.

	  In addition to the libpagekite library, this package installs
	  the pagekitec, sshkite and httpkite tools.
