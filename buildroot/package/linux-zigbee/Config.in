	  IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard for communication in small
	  low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPAN). While
	  802.15.4 is a MAC- and PHY- layer standard only, several
	  common protocols commonly sit on top of it such as ZigBee,
	  MiWi, and 6LoWPAN. The goal of this project is to create an
	  implementation of 802.15.4 and several of the protocols
	  which run on top of it (primarily 6LoWPAN) for Linux.

	  It's worth noting that the name linux-zigbee is somewhat of
	  a misnomer. While this project was originally started to
	  create a ZigBee implementation for Linux, licensing
	  restrictions put in place by the ZigBee Alliance make it
	  impossible for an implementation of ZigBee to ever become
	  part of the Linux kernel. Once this licensing issue was
	  discovered, this project's primary focus shifted to IEEE
	  802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN. Other higher-layer standards may be
	  added at a future time.

	  The 802.15.4 stack contains kernel components, which are
	  part of the mainline Linux kernel, and userspace components,
	  available in this package.

	  Enable this option to install the Linux-ZigBee test programs
	  to the target.

	bool "compatibility with older kernels"
	help
	  Enable this option to get compatibility of the Linux-ZigBee
	  userspace tools with old kernels. Recent kernels know the
	  802.15.4 line discipline as N_IEEE802154 with the value 25,
	  but some older kernels had it with the values 22 or 19.
