	  This is a reimplementation of Matthew Garrett's tpmtotp
	  software for TPM 2.0 using the tpm2-tss software stack. Its
	  purpose is to attest the trustworthiness of a device against
	  a human using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP),
	  facilitating the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to bind the
	  TOTP secret to the known trustworthy system state. In
	  addition to the original tpmtotp, given the new capabilities
	  of in-TPM hmac calculation, the tpm2-totp's secret HMAC keys
	  do not have to be exported from the TPM to the CPU's RAM on
	  boot anymore.
