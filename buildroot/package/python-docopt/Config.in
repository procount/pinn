	  docopt helps you create most beautiful command-line
	  interfaces easily. The option parser is generated based on
	  the beautiful help message that you write yourself. This way
	  you don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code,
	  and instead can write only the help message-- the way you
	  want it.
