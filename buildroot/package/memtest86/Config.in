	  Memtest86+ is a bootable standalone memory test program.

	  Buildroot does not support packages with a '+' sign in their
	  name, which explains why it is named memtest86 and not
	  memtest86+.

	  Memtest86+ is a utility designed to test whether your memory
	  is in working order. It repeatedly writes an enormous amount
	  of different patterns to all memory locations and reads them
	  back again and verifies whether the result of the read is the
	  same as what was written to memory.

	  Memtest86+ will only work on 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets.
	  It boots as an i486 program and autodetects hardware. It can
	  be added to the grub2 boot menu by adding the following
	  lines to the bottom of /boot/grub/grub.cfg - note the use of
	  linux16.

	  menuentry "Memtest86+" {
	    linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin
	  }

	  Other boot loaders will have similar requirements.
