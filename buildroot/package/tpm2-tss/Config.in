	  OSS implementation of the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) TPM2
	  Software Stack (TSS). This stack consists of the following
	  layers from top to bottom:

	  * System API (SAPI) as described in the system level API and
	    TPM command transmission interface specification. This API
	    is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part
	    3 of the TPM2 specification. Additionally there are
	    asynchronous versions of each command. These asynchronous
	    variants may be useful for integration into event-driven
	    programming environments. Both the synchronous and
	    asynchronous API are exposed through a single library:
	    libtss2-sys.

	  * TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) that is described
	    in the same specification. This API provides a standard
	    interface to transmit / receive TPM command / response
	    buffers. It is expected that any number of libraries
	    implementing the TCTI API will be implemented as a way to
	    abstract various platform specific IPC mechanisms. Currently
	    this repository provides two TCTI implementations:
	    libtss2-tcti-device and libtss2-tcti-mssim. The prior should
	    be used for direct access to the TPM through the Linux
	    kernel driver. The later implements the protocol exposed by
	    the Microsoft software TPM2 simulator.
