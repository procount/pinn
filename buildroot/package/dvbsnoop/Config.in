	  Dvbsnoop is just a simple tool to analyze, view or debug a
	  transport stream (TS), program elementary stream (PES) or even
	  a program stream (PS). Dvbsnoop is trying to get input mostly
	  direct from a frontend (satellite or cable tuner inside a
	  set-top box for example) via DVB APIv3 to view into a TS, or a
	  demux to view PES or PS (also mostly inside the set-top box or
	  even PCI Card or USB Plug) but also from a file (recorded TS).
	  Dvbsnoop is working well on SD transport streams but may have
	  some limited functionality on HD transport streams
	  (DVB-{C,S,T}2 because of missing knowledge how to handle it.

	  Dvbsnoop itself doesn't do the tuning on the frontend, this
	  has to be done by external helpers or manually driver call.
	  The dvbsnoop tool was written while developing the software
	  Neutrino on the set-top box DBox2.
