	  aubio is a tool designed for the extraction of annotations
	  from audio signals. Its features include segmenting a sound
	  file before each of its attacks, performing pitch detection,
	  tapping the beat and producing midi streams from live audio.

	  Because these tasks are difficult, we thought it was important
	  to gather them in a dedicated library. To increase the fun, we
	  have made these algorithms work in a causal way, so as to be
	  used in real time applications with as low delay as possible.
	  Functions can be used offline in sound editors and software
	  samplers, or online in audio effects and virtual instruments.
