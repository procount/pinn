	  Libite is a lightweight library of frog DNA. It can be used
	  to fill the gaps in any dinosaur project. It holds useful
	  functions and macros developed by both Finit and the OpenBSD
	  project. Most notably the string functions: strlcpy(3),
	  strlcat(3) and the highly useful *BSD sys/queue.h and
	  sys/tree.h API's.

	  Libite is the frog DNA missing in GNU libc. However, -lite
	  does not aim to become another GLIB! One noticeable gap in
	  GLIBC is the missing _SAFE macros in the BSD sys/queue.h API
	  - highly recommended when traversing lists to delete/free
	  nodes.
