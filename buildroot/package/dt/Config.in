	  dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper
	  operation of peripherals, file systems, device drivers,
	  or any data stream supported by the operating system.
	  In its' simplest mode of operation, dt writes and then
	  verifys its' default data pattern, then displays
	  performance statisics and other test parameters
	  before exiting. Since verification of data is performed,
	  dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
