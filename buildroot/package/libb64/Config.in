	  libb64 is a library of ANSI C routines for fast encoding
	  and decoding of data into and from a base64-encoded format.
	  C++ wrappers are included, as well as the source code for
	  standalone encoding and decoding executables.

	  Base64 uses a subset of displayable ASCII characters, and is
	  therefore a useful encoding for storing binary data in a text
	  file, such as XML, or sending binary data over text-only
	  email.
