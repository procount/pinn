	  The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which
	  sit on top of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some
	  of the extension libraries. These experimental libraries
	  provide convenience functions and interfaces which make the
	  raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also
	  provide client-side code which is not strictly part of the X
	  protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

	  XCB util-renderutil module provides the following library:
	    - renderutil: Convenience functions for the Render
	      extension.
