	  X.Org driver for iMX6 GPU (Vivante)

	  Notice EGL and GLes2 APIs are correctly supported. This
	  driver should also be able to provide Desktop OpenGL
	  implementation but, this feature seems broken since quite
	  some time.

	  To use this driver, add correct configuration to your
	  /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

	  Section "Device"
	    [...]
	    Driver          "vivante"
	    Option          "vivante_fbdev" "/dev/fbX"
	  EndSection

	  Don't forget to load galcore.ko and create /dev/galcore
	  before using this driver (else, Xorg will exit with an
	  obscur message like "Segmentation fault at address 0xc").
