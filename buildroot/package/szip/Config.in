	  Szip is an implementation of the extended-Rice lossless
	  compression algorithm.

	  The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has
	  adopted the extended-Rice algorithm for international
	  standards for space applications[1,6,7]. Szip is reported to
	  provide fast and effective compression, specifically for the
	  EOS data generated by the NASA Earth Observatory System
	  (EOS)[1]. It was originally developed at University of New
	  Mexico (UNM) and integrated with HDF4 by UNM researchers and
	  developers.
