	  XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
	  compression format, which provides memory-hungry but
	  powerful compression (often better than bzip2) and fast,
	  easy decompression.

	  This package provides the command line tools for working
	  with XZ compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and
	  so on. They can also handle the older LZMA format, and if
	  invoked via appropriate symlinks will emulate the behavior
	  of the commands in the lzma package.
