	  Kismet - 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer,
	  and intrusion detection system.

	  Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw
	  monitoring (rfmon) mode, and can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, and
	  802.11g traffic.

	  Kismet identifies networks by passively collecting packets
	  and detecting standard named networks, detecting (and given
	  time, decloaking) hidden networks, and infering the presence
	  of nonbeaconing networks via data traffic.
