	  BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an
	  implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols
	  and provides an openly redistributable reference
	  implementation of the major components of the Domain
	  Name System, including:

	    * a Domain Name System server (named)
	    * a Domain Name System resolver library
	    * tools for verifying the proper operation of the DNS
	      server

	  The BIND DNS Server is used on the vast majority of name
	  serving machines on the Internet, providing a robust and
	  stable architecture on top of which an organization's naming
	  architecture can be built. The resolver library included in
	  the BIND distribution provides the standard APIs for
	  translation between domain names and Internet addresses and is
	  intended to be linked with applications requiring name
	  service.
