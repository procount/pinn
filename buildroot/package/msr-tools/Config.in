	  The MSR Tools project provides utilities to access x86
	  processor MSRs and CPU ID directly.

	  Those tools access the hardware through the
	  /dev/cpu/<cpu#>/msr and /dev/cpu/<cpu#>/cpuid devices. This
	  necessitates msr and cpuid support in the kernel, which
	  means you need a kernel compiled with configuration options
	  CONFIG_X86_CPUID and CONFIG_X86_MSR enabled.
