	  CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match
	  certain security-oriented characteristics, with the purpose
	  of stopping users from choosing passwords that are easy to
	  guess. CrackLib performs several tests on passwords: it
	  tries to generate words from a username and gecos entry and
	  checks those words against the password; it checks for
	  simplistic patterns in passwords; and it checks for the
	  password in a dictionary.
