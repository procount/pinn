	  Linux kernel modules for the LTTng 2.x kernel tracing
	  infrastructure.

	  Make sure your target kernel has the following config
	  options enabled:

	    * CONFIG_MODULES: loadable module support
	    * CONFIG_KALLSYMS: this is necessary until the few
	      required missing symbols are exported to GPL
	      modules from mainline
	    * CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS: needed for LTTng 2.x
	      clock source
	    * CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS: kernel tracepoint instrumentation
	      (enabled as a side-effect of any of the
	      perf/ftrace/blktrace instrumentation features)

	  The following kernel configuration options will
	  affect the features available from LTTng:

	    * CONFIG_HAVE_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINTS: system call tracing
	    * CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS: performance counters
	    * CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING: needed to allow block layer tracing
	    * CONFIG_KPROBES: dynamic probes
	    * CONFIG_KRETPROBES: dynamic function entry/return probes
	    * CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL: state dump of mapping between block
	      device number and name

	  The packaged version is compatible with Linux 2.6.38 to 3.16.
