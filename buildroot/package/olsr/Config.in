	  The Optimized Link State Routing protocol (OLSR) is a
	  routing protocol that is optimised for mobile ad-hoc
	  networks, sometimes called wireless mesh networks. It is a
	  proactive link-state routing protocol that floods a full
	  topology table to all nodes in the network which then
	  compute optimal forwarding paths locally.
