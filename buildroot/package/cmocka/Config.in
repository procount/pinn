	  cmocka is an elegant unit testing framework for C with support
	  for mock objects. It only requires the standard C library,
	  works on a range of computing platforms (including embedded)
	  and with different compilers. It is a fork of Google's very
	  popular cmockery unit testing framework to fix bugs and
	  support it in the future.
