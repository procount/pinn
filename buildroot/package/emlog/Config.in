	  emlog is a Linux kernel module that makes it easy to access
	  the most recent (and only the most recent) output from a
	  process. It works just like "tail -f" on a log file, except
	  that the storage required never grows. This can be useful in
	  embedded systems where there isn't enough memory or disk
	  space for keeping complete log files, but the most recent
	  debugging messages are sometimes needed (e.g., after an
	  error is observed).
