	  This is a set of cross-platform command line tools for
	  working with MPEG data.

	  The emphasis is on relatively simple tools which concentrate
	  on MPEG (H.264 and H.262) data packaged according to H.222
	  (i.e., TS or PS), with a particular interest in checking for
	  conformance.

	  Transport Stream (TS) is typically used for distribution of
	  cable and satellite data. Program Stream (PS) is typically
	  used to store data on DVDs.
