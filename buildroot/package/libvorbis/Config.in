	  Library for the Vorbis open source audio decoder
	  Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary,
	  patent-and-royalty-free, general-purpose compressed audio
	  format for mid to high quality (8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit,
	  polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and variable bitrates
	  from 16 to 128 kbps/channel.

	  This places Vorbis in the same competitive class as audio
	  representations such as MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but
	  higher performance than MPEG-1/2 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio
	  (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
