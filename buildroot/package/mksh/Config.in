	  The MirBSD Korn Shell,

	  mksh is a successor of pdksh but not affiliated with the
	  pdksh developers or contributors. mksh is not affiliated
	  with the AT&T Korn Shell, its past or present owners,
	  other than that both attempt to implement the Korn Shell
	  programming language.

	  mksh targets users who desire a compact, fast, reliable,
	  secure shell not cut off modern extensions; a shell with
	  Unicode support; an actively developed, current, and
	  portable product; one with developers that listen to
	  their users' requests and implement them if they
	  actually make sense.

	  mksh aims to replace pdksh in all but very rare use cases
	  (such as support for checking the Unix mbox) and in all
	  operating environments
	  (thus including patches from pdksh on e.g. Debian).
