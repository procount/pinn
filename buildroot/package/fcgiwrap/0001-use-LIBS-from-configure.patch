Makefile.in: Use LIBS from configure rather than specifying -lfcgi manually.

libfcgi needs libm and fcgiwrap does not use libtool or pkgconf to
detect libfcgi, so we need to add -lm explicitely when using static
libs.  Buildroot does this by providing LIBS=-lm to configure when
needed.  However fcgiwrap does not use Automake and its Makefile.in
ignores LIBS from configure.  Fix it with this patch.
