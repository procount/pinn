	  Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. The
	  automount daemons automatically mount filesystems when they
	  are used and unmount them after a period of inactivity based
	  on a set of pre-configured maps defined by default in
	  /etc/auto.master. The kernel automounter implements SunOS
	  style automounter under Linux and requires a kernel version
	  of at least 2.6.17 and the autofs4 kernel module.
