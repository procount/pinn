	  The Spice project aims to provide a complete open source
	  solution for interaction with virtualized desktop devices.
	  The Spice project deals with both the virtualized devices
	  and the front-end. Interaction between front-end and
	  back-end is done using VD-Interfaces.

	  This package implements the slirp-part for Spice. Slirp
	  emulates a PPP or SLIP connection over a normal terminal.

	  NOTE:
	  This package has some history of a unique kind:
	    - originally developped as 'slirp' by Danny Gasparovski, and
	      seemingly abandonned (developper /disapeared/)
	    - then re-maintained at sourceforge by "Kelly", up to some
	      time around 2009: http://slirp.sourceforge.net/
	    - during that period, QEMU (Fabrice BELLARD) forked the code
	      and included it in QEMU
	    - and it was imported from this breed by the Spice project
	      around May 2009
	    - which is what we use here
