	  This is a small, flexible library that provides a simple
	  interface for defining and accessing command line
	  arguments. It was initially inspired by the user friendly
	  CLAP libary. The difference is that this library is
	  templatized, so the argument class is type independent. Type
	  independence avoids identical-except-for-type objects, such
	  as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg. While the library is not
	  strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards, it is
	  close.
