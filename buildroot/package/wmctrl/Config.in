	  Provides command line access to almost all the features
	  defined in the EWMH specification. It can be used, for
	  example, to get information about the window manager, to get
	  a detailed list of desktops and managed windows, to switch
	  and resize desktops, to make windows full-screen,
	  always-above or sticky, and to activate, close, move,
	  resize, maximize and minimize them.
