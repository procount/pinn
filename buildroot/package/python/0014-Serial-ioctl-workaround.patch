Subject: [PATCH] Serial ioctl() workaround

The ioctls.h of some architectures (notably xtensa) references structs from
linux/serial.h. Make sure to include this header as well.

Also, undef TIOCTTYGSTRUCT that require reference to internal kernel tty_struct,
but isn't actually referenced in modern kernels.
