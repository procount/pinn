	  Nanocom is based upon microcom (http://microcom.port5.com/)
	  but removes the scripting and logging features while
	  introducing support for setting local/remote echo, parity
	  and stop bits. It also follows a more standard command line
	  style using the getopt function.  Internally much of the
	  code has been rewritten and reformatted, the menu system in
	  particular is almost entirely different.
