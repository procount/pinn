	  SPI testing utility (using spidev driver).

	  This package builds and installs the userspace 'spidev_test'
	  command. It is up to the user to ensure that the kernel
	  configuration has all suitable options enabled to allow a
	  proper operation of 'spidev_test'.

	  The version used is based on your toolchain headers version,
	  if it's older than 3.15 then 3.0 is used, otherwise 3.15
	  is used.
	  This means you won't have quad-pumped SPI support if your
	  toolchain is too old.
