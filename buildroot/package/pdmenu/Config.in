	  Pdmenu is a full screen menuing system for Unix. It is
	  designed to be easy to use, and is suitable as a login shell
	  for inexperienced users, or it can just be ran at the
	  command line as a handy menu.

	  Pdmenu features color support and GPM mouse support at the
	  Linux console. It was developed on Linux, and has now been
	  compiled on many other unixes without problems.
