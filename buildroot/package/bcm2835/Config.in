	  C library for Broadcom BCM 2835 as used in Raspberry Pi.
	  It provides access to GPIO and other IO functions on the
	  Broadcom BCM 2835 chip, allowing access to the GPIO pins
	  on the 26 pin IDE plug on the RPi board so you can control
	  and interface with various external devices.

	  WARNING: the opinion of the Buildroot developers is that
	  such library is a complete abomination as it entirely works
	  around the standard Linux interfaces to access GPIOs, I2C,
	  SPI busses or other IOs. The library directly remaps the
	  hardware registers in user-space, completely bypassing what
	  the kernel drivers are doing, and potentially conflicting
	  with them.
