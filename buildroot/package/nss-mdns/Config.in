	  nss-mdns is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
	  functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host
	  name resolution via Multicast DNS (aka Zeroconf, aka Apple
	  Rendezvous, aka Apple Bonjour), effectively allowing name
	  resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc
	  mDNS domain .local.
