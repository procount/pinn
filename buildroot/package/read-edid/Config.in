	  Read-edid is a pair of tools for reading the EDID from a
	  monitor. It should work with most monitors made since 1996
	  (except for newer ones with 256-byte EDID's - WiP), assuming
	  the video card supports the standard read commands (most
	  do). Read-edid is a set of two tools - get-edid, which gets
	  the raw edid information from the monitor, and parse-edid,
	  which turns the raw binary information into an
	  XF86Config-compatible monitor section.
