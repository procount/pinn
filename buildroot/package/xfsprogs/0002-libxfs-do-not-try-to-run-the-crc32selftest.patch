Subject: [PATCH] libxfs: do not try to run the crc32selftest

Even though the crc32selftest is natively compiled (because it is to be
executed), it fails in cross-compilation as the host may lack the
required headers, like uuid/uuid.h (e.g. in a minimal environment).

Moreover, running the crc32selftest natively is completely wrong,
because it passing on the host does not mean it would still pass n the
target (because endianness or bitness or alignment differences).

So, just disable running the crc32selftest altogether.

Note that there's a remaining bug-in-hiding, because the crc32 table
generator is natively built, but with the target CFLAGS.

[Update for 4.18.0: crc32 has been moved from libxfs to libfrog]
