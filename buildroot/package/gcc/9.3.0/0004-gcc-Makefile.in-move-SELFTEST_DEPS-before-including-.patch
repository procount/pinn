Subject: [PATCH] gcc/Makefile.in: move SELFTEST_DEPS before including language
 makefile fragments

As reported by several Buildroot users [1][2][3], the gcc build
may fail while running selftests makefile target.

The problem only occurs when ccache is used with gcc 9 and 10,
probably due to a race condition.

While debuging with "make -p" we can notice that s-selftest-c target
contain only "cc1" as dependency instead of cc1 and SELFTEST_DEPS [4].

  s-selftest-c: cc1

While the build is failing, the s-selftest-c dependencies recipe is
still running and reported as a bug by make.

  "Dependencies recipe running (THIS IS A BUG)."

A change [5] in gcc 9 seems to introduce the problem since we can't
reproduce this problem with gcc 8.

As suggested by Yann E. MORIN [6], move SELFTEST_DEPS before
including language makefile fragments.

With the fix applied, the s-seltest-c dependency contains
SELFTEST_DEPS value.
