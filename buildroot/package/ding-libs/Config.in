	  The ding-libs packages contain a set of libraries used by
	  the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) and other
	  projects and provide functions to manipulate filesystem
	  pathnames (libpath_utils), a hash table to manage storage
	  and access time properties (libdhash), a data type to
	  collect data in a hierarchical structure (libcollection), a
	  dynamically growing, reference-counted array (libref_array),
	  and a library to process configuration files in
	  initialization format (INI) into a library collection data
	  structure (libini_config).
