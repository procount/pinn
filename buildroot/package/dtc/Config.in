	  The Device Tree Compiler, dtc, takes as input a device-tree in
	  a given format and outputs a device-tree in another format.

	  Note that only the library is installed.
	  If you want the programs, say 'y' here, and to "dtc programs",
	  below.

	  Say 'y' here if you also want the programs on the target:
	    - convert-dtsv0     convert from version 0 to version 1
	    - dtc               the device tree compiler
	    - dtdiff            compare two device trees (needs bash)
	    - fdtdump           print a readable version of a
	                        flat device tree
	    - fdtget            read values from device tree
	    - fdtput            write a property value to a device tree

	  Note: dtdiff requires bash, so if bash is not selected, dtdiff
	  will be removed from the target file system. Enable bash if
	  you need dtdiff on the target.
