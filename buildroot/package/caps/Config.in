	  CAPS is a collection of audio plugins comprising virtual
	  guitar amplification and a small range of basic classic
	  effects, signal processors and generators of often
	  elementary and occasionally exotic nature.

	  The plugins aim to satisfy the highest demands in sound
	  quality with maximal computational efficiency and zero
	  latency.
