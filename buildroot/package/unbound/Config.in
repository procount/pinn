	  Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.
	  It supports DNSSEC, QNAME minimisation, DNS-over-TLS and
	  DNSCrypt.

	  DNSCrypt wraps unmodified DNS queries between a client and
	  a DNS resolver. Default port used is 443 and like with
	  normal unencrypted DNS, it uses UDP first and falling back
	  to TCP if response too large.

	  There is also DNS-over-TLS, a TCP only version
	  of proposed standard for DNS encryption (RFC 7858).
	  Default port for DNS-over-TLS is 853 and Unbound has
	  built-in support for it.

	  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858

	  Note: Neither DNSCrypt or DNS-over-TLS encrypt the SNI.
	  Here is some suggestions how to handle SNI encryption:
