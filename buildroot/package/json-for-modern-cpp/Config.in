	  Json for modern c++ has the following desing goals in mind:

	  - Intuitive syntax. In languages such as Python, JSON feels
	    like a first class data type. All the operator magic of
	    modern C++ is used to achieve the same feeling in c++.

	  - Trivial integration. The whole code consists of a single
	    header file json.hpp. That's it. No library, no
	    subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The
	    class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything
	    should require no adjustment of compiler flags or project
	    settings.

	  - Serious testing. The class is heavily unit-tested and
	    covers 100% of the code, including all exceptional
	    behavior.  Furthermore, it is checked with Valgrind that
	    there are no memory leaks. To maintain high quality, the
	    project is following the Core Infrastructure Initiative
	    (CII) best practices.
