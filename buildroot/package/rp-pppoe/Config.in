	  An implementation of the Point-to-point protocol over
	  Ethernet.  Has userspace client and server deamons. You
	  likely only need this package if you are implementing the
	  pppoe server that will service other pppoe client
	  devices. Otherwise the normal client functionality already
	  exists in the pppd package (and kernel).
