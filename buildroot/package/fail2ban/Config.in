	  Fail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error_log) and
	  bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password
	  failures, seeking for exploits, etc. Out of the box Fail2Ban
	  comes with filters for various services (apache, courier,
	  ssh, etc).

	  Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect
	  authentications attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk
	  that weak authentication presents.
