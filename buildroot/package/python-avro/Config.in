	  Apache Avro is a data serialization system.
	  Avro provides:
	  - Rich data structures.
	  - A compact, fast, binary data format.
	  - A container file, to store persistent data.
	  - Remote procedure call (RPC).
	  - Simple integration with dynamic languages.
	  - Code generation is not required to read or write data
	    files nor to use or implement RPC protocols.
	  - Code generation as an optional optimization,
	    only worth implementing for statically typed languages.
