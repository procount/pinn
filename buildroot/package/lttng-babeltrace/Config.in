	  The Babeltrace project provides trace read and write
	  libraries, as well as a trace converter application. Plugins
	  can be created for any trace format to allow its conversion
	  to/from another trace format.

	  Babeltrace is the reference implementation of the Common
	  Trace Format (see <http://diamon.org/ctf/>). Babeltrace
	  can decode and display LTTng traces, since the latter are
	  written using the CTF format.

	  To get support for debugging information, enable the
	  elfutils package.

	  Having this tool on the target is not mandatory. You can
	  transfer the binary trace output from the target to your
	  development workstation, and use babeltrace here.

	  See the lttng-babeltrace host utility to install Babeltrace
	  on the host.
