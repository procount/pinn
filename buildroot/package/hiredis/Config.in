	  Minimalistic C client for Redis >= 1.2

	  It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for
	  the protocol, but at the same time it uses a high level
	  printf-alike API in order to make it much higher level than
	  otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and the lack of
	  explicit bindings for every Redis command.
