	help
	  Delete encoding files for TCL. If your programs do not use
	  various tcl character recoding functions, you may safely
	  choose Y here.

	  It saves approx. 1.6 Mb of space.

config BR2_PACKAGE_TCL_SHLIB_ONLY
	bool "install only shared library"
	default y
	help
	  Install only TCL shared library and not binary tcl
	  interpreter (tclsh).

	  Saves ~14kb.
