	  Generic-purpose lossless compression library. The algorithm
	  compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of
	  the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context
	  modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best
	  currently available general-purpose compression methods. It
	  is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense
	  compression.
