	  fscryptctl is a low-level tool written in C that handles raw
	  keys and manages policies for Linux filesystem encryption.

	  Notice: Fscrypt support on EXT4 requires a kernel with
	  CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y and a file system with the
	  encryption option and block size equal to CPU page size
	  (BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_MKFS_OPTIONS="-O encrypt -b 4096")
