	  Universal configuration library parser

	  Libucl is a parser and C API to parse and generate ucl
	  objects. Libucl consist of several groups of functions:
	  parser, emitting, conversion, generation, iteration,
	  validation, and utility. These functions can be used to work
	  with several formats: JSON, compact JSON, configuration
	  (nginx like), and YAML. Libucl has clear design that should
	  be very convenient for reading and writing and makes for an
	  ideal parser with high performance.
