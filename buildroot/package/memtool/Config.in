	  Development tool to modify memory mapped registers.

	  memtool allows one to read and write memory mapped registers
	  via /dev/mem. The commands are inspired by the respective
	  commands of the barebox bootloader.  This is handy during
	  driver development to inspect and modify register
	  settings. It can also be used to modify regular files and
	  character devices (e.g. to paint to /dev/fb0).
