	  Darkhttpd is a simple, fast HTTP 1.1 web server which only
	  serves static content. It does not support PHP or CGI.

	  The behavior of darkhttpd can be altered by setting some
	  variables in /etc/default/darkhttpd:

	  - DARKHTTPD_ROOT: path to the server document root.
	  - DARKHTTPD_FLAGS: options to pass to darkhttpd.
