	  omniORB is a robust high performance CORBA ORB for C++ and
	  Python.
	  omniORB is largely CORBA 2.6 compliant. omniORB is one of
	  only three ORBs to have been awarded the Open Group's Open
	  Brand for CORBA. This means that omniORB has been tested and
	  certified CORBA compliant, to version 2.1 of the CORBA
	  specification.
