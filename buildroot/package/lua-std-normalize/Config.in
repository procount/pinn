	  This module can inject deterministic versions of core Lua
	  functions that do not behave identically across all
	  supported Lua implementations into your module's lexical
	  environment.  Each function is as thin and fast a version as
	  is possible in each Lua implementation, evaluating to the
	  Lua C implementation with no overhead when semantics allow.
