	  ktap is a script-based dynamic tracing tool for Linux

	  It uses a scripting language and lets users trace the Linux
	  kernel dynamically. ktap is designed to give operational
	  insights with interoperability that allows users to tune,
	  troubleshoot and extend kernel and application.
	  It's similar to Linux Systemtap and Solaris Dtrace.

	  ktap doesn't support kernels older than 3.1.

	  To be able to resolve symbols in DSO and for sdt, you need to
	  enable elfutils.

	  Your kernel must have CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING,
	  CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS, and CONFIG_DEBUG_FS enabled to compile.

	  Buildroot automatically enables these in the kernel
	  configuration.
