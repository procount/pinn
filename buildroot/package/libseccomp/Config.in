	  High level interface to the Linux Kernel's seccomp filter

	  The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform
	  independent, interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering
	  mechanism: seccomp. The libseccomp API is designed to abstract
	  away the underlying BPF based syscall filter language and
	  present a more conventional function-call based filtering
	  interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by
	  application developers.
