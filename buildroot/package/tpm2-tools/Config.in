	  TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0 CLI tools based on system
	  API of TPM2-TSS. These tools can be used to manage keys,
	  perform encryption/decryption/signing/etc crypto operations,
	  and manage non-volatile storage through a TPM2.0 HW
	  implementation.

	  Notice: An in-kernel resource manager is provided by the
	  Linux kernel since 4.12. Depending on use cases and kernel
	  version, the user space resource manager provided by
	  tpm2-abrmd may be needed.
