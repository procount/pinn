	  tcping does a TCP connect to the given ip/port
	  combination. The user can specify a timeout in seconds. This
	  is useful in shell scripts running in firewalled
	  environments. Often SYNs are just being dropped by
	  firewalls, thus connection establishment will be retried
	  several times (for minutes) until a TCP timeout is
	  reached. With tcping it is possible to check first if the
	  desired port is reachable and then start connection
	  establishment.
