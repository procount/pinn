	  Flot is a pure Javascript plotting library for jQuery. It
	  produces graphical plots of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly
	  client-side.

	  The focus is on simple usage (all settings are optional),
	  attractive looks and interactive features like zooming and
	  mouse tracking.

	  The plugin works with Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2.x+,
	  Safari 3.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Konqueror 4.x+ with the HTML
	  canvas tag.
