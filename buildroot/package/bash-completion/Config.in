	  Add bash completion infrastructure.

	  The bash completion infrastructure is enabled by
	  /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh, which is normally
	  sourced by /etc/profile.

	  If the system does not use the /etc/profile.d directory
	  mechanism, the /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh script can
	  be sourced from /etc/bashrc or ~/.bashrc.
