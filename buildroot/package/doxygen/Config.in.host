	  Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating
	  documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also
	  supports other popular programming languages such as C,
	  Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft,
	  and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some
	  extent D.
