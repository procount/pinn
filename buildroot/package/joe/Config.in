	  Joe's Own Editor

	  JOE is an easy-to-use, full featured terminal-based screen
	  editor. Its behavior is a blending of WordStar and GNU-EMACS
	  (but it does not use code from either program).
	  It is a great editor for new users or as an alternative to vi.

	  option only the joe binary is installed, which contains a
