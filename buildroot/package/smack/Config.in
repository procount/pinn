	  User space programs and libraries for SMACK.

	  SMACK stands for Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel.
	  It is a Linux Security Module which provides a Mandatory
	  Access Control mechanism, aimed towards simplicity.

	  This package provides a library which allows applications to
	  work with SMACK and tools to load/unload rules from the
	  kernel, as well as query the policy.

	  SMACK requires the following kernel options to be enabled:

	  - CONFIG_SECURITY
	  - CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK
	  - CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK

	  These options will be automatically enabled by Buildroot if
	  it is responsible for building the kernel. Otherwise, if you
	  are building your kernel outside of Buildroot, make sure
	  these options are enabled.

	  To activate SMACK, do not forget to add "security=smack" to
	  your kernel command line.
