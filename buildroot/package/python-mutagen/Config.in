	  Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata.  It
	  supports ASF, FLAC, MP4, Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg
	  Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True
	  Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG, and AIFF audio files. All
	  versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4
	  frames are parsed.

	  It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate
	  and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited
	  regardless of audio format.  It can also manipulate Ogg
	  streams on an individual packet/page level.
