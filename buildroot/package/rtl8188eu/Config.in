	  A standalone driver for the RTL8188EU USB Wi-Fi adapter.
	  This is needed only for Linux kernels before 3.12.
	  Since 3.12, there is a (staging) driver in mainline, with a
	  similar codebase.

	  Make sure your target kernel has the CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT
	  config option enabled.

	  Note: this package needs a firmware loading mechanism to load
	  the binary blob for the chip to work.
