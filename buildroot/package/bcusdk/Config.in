	  A free development environment for the Bus Coupling Units of
	  the European Installation Bus.

	  The European Installation Bus EIB is a home and building
	  automation bus system. It is optimized for low-speed control
	  applications like lighting and blinds control.

	  BCUs (Bus Coupling Units) are standardized, generic
	  platforms for embedded EIB devices. They include the entire
	  physical layer network interface, power supply and a
	  microcontroller with an implementation of the EIB protocol
	  stack stored in the ROM.
