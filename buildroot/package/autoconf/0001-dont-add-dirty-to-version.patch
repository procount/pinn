autoconf: don't append -dirty to version

Don't append -dirty to autoconf version number if the buildroot git tree
has uncommited changes.

This script is meant for the autoconf developers, but it also activates
if you build autoconf in a subdirectory of a git tree (E.G. like how it's
commonly done in buildroot).

The affect is that autoconf gets built as being version 2.65-dirty, which
breaks programs (like Python) which explicitly checks for autoconf-2.65.
