	  Httping is like 'ping' but for http-requests.
	  Give it an url, and it'll show you how long it takes to
	  connect, send a request and retrieve the reply (only the
	  headers).
	  Be aware that the transmission across the network also takes
	  time! So it measures the latency of the webserver + network.
