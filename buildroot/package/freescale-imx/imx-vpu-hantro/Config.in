	  Library of userspace helpers specific for the NXP i.MX SoC
	  integrating a Hantro Video Processing Unit (VPU) such as the
	  i.MX8MQ/i.MX8MM.
	  It requires a kernel that includes the i.MX specific headers
	  to be built.

	  This library is provided by NXP as-is and doesn't have an
	  upstream.
