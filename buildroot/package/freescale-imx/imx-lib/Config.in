	  Library of userspace helpers specific for the Freescale i.MX
	  platform. It wraps the kernel interfaces for some i.MX
	  platform specific drivers. It requires a kernel that
	  includes the i.MX specific headers to be built.

	  This library is provided by Freescale as-is and doesn't have
	  an upstream.
