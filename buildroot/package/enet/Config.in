	  ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple
	  and robust network communication layer on top of UDP
	  (User Datagram Protocol).The primary feature it
	  provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of
	  packets.

	  ENet omits certain higher level networking features
	  such as authentication, lobbying, server discovery,
	  encryption, or other similar tasks that are
	  particularly application specific so that the library
	  remains flexible, portable, and easily embeddable.
