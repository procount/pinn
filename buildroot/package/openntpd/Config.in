	  OpenNTPD is an easy to use implementation of the Network Time
	  Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock
	  to remote NTP servers and can act as NTP server itself,
	  redistributing the local clock. It just works.

	  Crypto support is available if the LibreSSL library is
	  enabled.
