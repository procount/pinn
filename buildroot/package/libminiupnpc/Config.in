	  The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers
	  and Microsoft Windows 2K/XP. The aim of the MiniUPnP project
	  is to bring a free software solution to support the "Internet
	  Gateway Device" part of the protocol.

	  Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the
	  smallest footprint and no dependencies to other libraries such
	  as XML parsers or HTTP implementations. All the code is pure
	  ANSI C.
