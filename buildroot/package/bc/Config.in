	  'bc' is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language
	  Its syntax is similar to C, but differs in many substantial
	  areas. It supports interactive execution of statements. 'Bc'
	  is a utility included in the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.
	  This version does not use the historical method of having bc
	  be a compiler for the dc calculator (the POSIX document
	  doesn't specify how bc must be implemented).
	  This version has a single executable that both compiles the
	  language and runs the resulting 'byte code.' The byte code is
	  not the dc language.
