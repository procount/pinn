	  Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and
	  writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP
	  protocol.
	  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be
	  used directly or easily driven by other programs and
	  scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network
	  debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost
	  any kind of connection you would need and has several
	  interesting built-in capabilities.
