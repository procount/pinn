	  ASGI is a standard for Python asynchronous web apps and
	  servers to communicate with each other, and positioned as
	  an asynchronous successor to WSGI.

	  This package includes ASGI base libraries, such as:
	    - Sync-to-async and async-to-sync function wrappers,
	      asgiref.sync
	    - Server base classes, asgiref.server
	    - A WSGI-to-ASGI adapter, in asgiref.wsgi
