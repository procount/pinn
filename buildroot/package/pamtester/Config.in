	  A tiny utility for testing pluggable authentication modules
	  (PAM) facility. While specifically designed to help PAM module
	  authors to test their modules, that might also be handy for
	  system administrators interested in building a centralised
	  authentication system using common standards such as NIS, SASL
	  and LDAP.
