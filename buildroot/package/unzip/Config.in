	  UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in
	  .zip format (also called "zipfiles"). Although highly
	  compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities
	  for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our primary
	  objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS
	  functionality.
