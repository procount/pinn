	  c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be
	  used with HTTP proxies that support the ICAP protocol to
	  implement content adaptation and filtering services.  Most
	  of the commercial HTTP proxies must support the ICAP
	  protocol.  The open source Squid 3.x proxy server supports
	  it.
