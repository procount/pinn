 *
 * QWaitCondition is designed to coordinate mutex waiting between different threads.
 * But what makes this work is the wait method has a timeout on it. When called this way,
 * it functions exactly like a sleep function, but it uses Qt's event loop for the timing.
 * So, no other events or the UI are blocked like normal windows sleep function does.
 *
 * As a bonus, we added the CancelSleep function to allows another part of the program to cancel the "sleep" function.
 *
 * What we liked about this is that it lightweight, reusable and is completely self contained.
